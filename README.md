# Innovest
Innovest: A Bank Management System with Innovative Investment Features.

# Project Overview ---
Innovest is a banking management software created to empower individuals with limited financial resources, such as students, middle-class families, and small business owners. This project not only supports basic banking functions like deposits, transfers, and balance inquiries but also introduces a unique, fee-based investment system, making investment opportunities more accessible.

The software, initially designed for banks, can eventually evolve into an independent app with the potential to operate as a standalone service similar to bKash or Tap Tap Send.

# Features ---
Innovest offers a range of essential and innovative banking features:

User Accounts: Sign up, log in, view account balance, and manage transactions.

Admin Accounts: Admins can log in, view, and manage user data.

Deposit and Withdrawal: Users can deposit money with verification and view an updated balance.

Money Transfer: Users can transfer money to other accounts within the system.

Investment Options: Users can invest with a service fee and choose from a variety of options, including Tech Company A, B, C, D, and E.

Transaction History: View logs of deposits, transfers, and investments.
